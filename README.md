# Lampi (or Phlamp) Instructions

Here are the instructions for your brand new-ish internet connected lamp (don't you feel cutting edge?)

### Initial setup

First off we need to get you connected to the internet.  This is the trickiest part so don't hesitate to reach out to me if you run into any issues.  

* Don't plug your Phlamp in yet
* If your router is an Apple Airport
  1. Open Airport Utility on your Mac, click on your router in the little diagram, and choose "Add Wireless Clientsâ€¦" from the Base Station menu at the top of the screen.
  2. A dialog should pop up and one of the options should be "First Attempt".  Select that option, but **don't click the okay button yet**
  3. Plug in your Phlamp and wait for the 2nd light to start blinking.  Wait a bit longer until it starts blinking faster
  4. Click the okay button on that dialog on your Mac
  5. After a bit, that 2nd light should turn solid meaning the Phlamp is successfully connected to the internet
* If your router is something else
  1. If it is a recent enough router, there should be a [WPS button](https://www.google.com/search?q=wps+button+on+router&espv=2&biw=1366&bih=638&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj7qIuY36fRAhUJ0iYKHSYxBIMQ_AUIBigB "Images of WPS buttons") somewhere on the router.  Locate this button but don't push it yet.
  2. Plug in your Phlamp and wait for the 2nd light to start blinking.  Wait a bit longer until it starts blinking faster
  3. Push the WPS button on your router
  4. After a bit, that 2nd light should turn solid meaning the Phlamp is successfully connected to the internet
* After the Phlamp is connected to the internet, it will start updating itself.  This could take a minute or two, but not much longer than that.  
* During the update, the lights might do strange things, but at the end the top light should be on and the bottom lights should all be solid
  * If the lights don't look like this after 5 minutes or so, unplug your Phlamp, wait 15 seconds, then plug it back in.  If they still look weird, call me and I will see if I can figure out what's wrong.

## Functionality

The Phlamp has only a couple of features so far, but I plan on adding more as time goes on.  Below is a list of what is currently available.

#### Who's online

You can see who is online at a glance by looking at the 3 picture buttons.  If the button is lit up, the corresponding Phlamp is turned on.

#### Send a message

You can send a message to another Phlamp by
1. pushing one of the bottom message buttons
2. pushing the picture of someone who is online (their button needs to be lit up for you to send them a message).  

After this you should see a brief notification that the message was sent.

If you want to see what a message will look like before you send it, you can push a message button twice.

#### Turn Off

You can turn off your Phlamp without unplugging it by pressing and holding the blue teardrop button for about 2 seconds.  The top lamp should turn off and you will effectively be 'offline'.  Note that no one will be able to send you messages when your lamp is in this state.  

#### Turn On

You can turn your Phlamp back on by pressing the blue teardrop button once.


### Future Functionality

Here are some features I have planned for the future:
* multi-part messages: be able to send sun+heart, or tree+sun+teardrop to someone
* different idle modes: be able to have the normal state of the lamp be something more interesting than plain white light.
* easter eggs: you know you want 'em!
